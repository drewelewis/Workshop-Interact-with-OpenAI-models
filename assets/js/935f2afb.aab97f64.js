In this section, we\'ll explore some other useful applications of these models.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/Understand-LLMs":{"id":"concepts/Understand-LLMs","title":"Large Language Model (LLM)","description":"A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI that can process and produce natural language text. It learns from a massive amount of text data such as books, articles, and web pages to discover patterns and rules of language from them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/Understand-Tokens":{"id":"concepts/Understand-Tokens","title":"Tokenization","description":"We\'ve mentioned \\"tokens\\" a few times in previous lessons, but we didn\'t explain what those were and why they matter. Let\'s discuss that now.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Get-Started":{"id":"Get-Started","title":"Get started","description":"- Use your own laptop.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"labs/Add-Knowledge":{"id":"labs/Add-Knowledge","title":"Add knowledge","description":"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that retrieves relevant information from a database and then uses it to help generate more informed and contextually accurate text responses.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"labs/Basic-Prompting":{"id":"labs/Basic-Prompting","title":"Basic Prompting","description":"Prompt engineering is a concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves embedding descriptions of tasks in input to prompt the model to output the desired results.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"labs/Conversation-history":{"id":"labs/Conversation-history","title":"Conversation history","description":"Consumer conversational AI services like ChatGPT and Bing Chat use a trick to make the AI agent seem to remember the context of the conversation. The trick is that the foundation model is given the whole chat history at each turn, not just the latest prompt, but the user does not see this. An AI model cannot learn and has no memory of previous interactions if the user leaves and comes back but the application is using prompt engineering to add this \'memory\'","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"labs/Create-Images":{"id":"labs/Create-Images","title":"Create Images","description":"DALL-E is a neural network based model that can generate graphical data from natural language input.

They generate responses based on pre-training with a large dataset and do not update their knowledge from individual conversations. Any improvements or updates to the model\'s capabilities are made through a controlled retraining process by OpenAI, not through real-time learning.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"labs/System-Message":{"id":"labs/System-Message","title":"System Message","description":"The system message is used to communicate instructions or provide context to the model at the beginning of a conversation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"summary/At-home":{"id":"summary/At-home","title":"Instructor-Led (Event)","description":"2.
